# WeatherApi

## Overview
This project is a weather API service with a frontend application. It uses Redis for caching API responses to improve performance and reduce external API calls.

## Prerequisites
* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the WeatherApi up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <remote-repo-url>
   cd WeatherApi
   ```

2. **Configure API Key:**
   - Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project root.
   - Locate the "ApiKey" field.
   - Insert your API key:
     ```json
     {
       "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
     }
     ```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd WeatherApi
   ```

4. **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the WeatherApi and its dependencies.

5. **Access the Application:**
   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the WeatherApi frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.
